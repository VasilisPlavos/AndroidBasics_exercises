### About the Idea
Hey there! Here is my WU Killa Qeez Application. It is a project for the [Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics](https://blog.udacity.com/2017/09/announcing-60000-challenge-scholarships-udacity-google.html). It is my first experience with Android Studio and Android Development and it was really fun for me. In real life, I am a Digital Marketing Innovator and I am coding for my job very often. Everyday I am learing more and more about coding because I think it is really important for what I do.
### About Installation
You can run my code at Android Studio or you can download the [APK file](https://github.com/PlavosVasilis/AndroidBasics_exercises/blob/master/WUKillaQeez/WUKillaQeez%20v0.0.36.apk) and run it at your mobile.
### Creator's Mood for the App
I will improve the app really soon. [I would like to hear ideas for improvement!](https://discord.gg/RbfTJZz)
